## 3DBARE: a virtual audio project

My PhD thesis was an exploration of the problems encountered when composing music that allows the listener to dismantle and reconstitute the whole in a virtual environment.

To this end, I invented a way for listeners to ohysically enter a virtual space using motion-tracked headsets and a very cool piece of software.

Background and outline description of the proof-of-concept  [here](https://github.com/ZoI19/samples/blob/master/sample-3Daudio.pdf).
