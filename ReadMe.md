## Overview
_Generated in Visual Studio Code as Markdown file._

The three pieces summarised and linked below are samples of recent work over a diverse technical writing career.

## User Guide and Dictionary of Terms

_Generated in MS Word, Visio and Excel. Combined as PDF for publication._

I built a Document Management System (DMS) for Siemens Thameslink. This is the User Guide compiled to assist rail depot engineers in rapidly finding required data.

It contains 

- Instructions for easy use, 
- Map of DMS structure, 
- Dictionary of 700 terms used to categorise over 50,000 documents.  

The Dictionary is in two parts: document types (pp24-28) and equipment (pp29-48).

It facilitates rapid search of the DMS for any document by depot, location, document type or equipment.

## API documentation example

_Generated in Visual Studio Code as Markdown file._

This redacted excerpt from API documentation for an employer's GitHub gives instruction on authentication admin for third party apps integrating with their front end application.

The company name is changed to 'DevSpace' and  company-specific configurations have been randomised.

## 3DBARE: a virtual audio project

My PhD thesis (Music Composition and Virtual Reality)  was an exploration of solutions to problems encountered when permitting a listener to dismantle and reconstitute a musical composition in a virtual environment.

I invented and co-developed 3DBARE (three dimensional binaural audio rendering engine) for listeners to physically enter a virtually spatialised multi-channel 3D soundscape using motion-tracked headsets and software.

Background and description of proof-of-concept  [here](https://github.com/ZoI19/samples/blob/master/sample-3Daudio.pdf).
